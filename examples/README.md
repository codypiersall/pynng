Adding an Example
-----------------

More examples are welcome.  To add an example:
1. create a new file in this directory that demonstrates what needs to be
   demonstrated
2. Make sure there is a docstring in the file that describes what it is
   demonstrating.  Add as much detail as is needed.  Show example in the
   docstring as well.
3. Add a short description of what the example does to the list of descriptions
   in this file.  Keep the list in alphabetical order.

Don't call out to third-party code if you can help it.  Keep examples simple.
